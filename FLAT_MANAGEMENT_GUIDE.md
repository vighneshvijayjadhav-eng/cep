# 🏢 Flat Management Dashboard - User Guide

## Overview
The new Flat Management Dashboard allows administrators to add flat information once, so users don't have to repeatedly enter the same details when making payments.

## How It Works

### For Administrators:

1. **Access Admin Dashboard**
   - Click "⚙️ Manage Flats" in the navigation bar
   - This opens the Flat Management Dashboard

2. **Add New Flat**
   - Click "➕ Add New Flat" button
   - Fill in the flat details:
     - Society Name
     - Flat Number (e.g., A-101)
     - Wing/Block (optional)
     - Floor (optional)
     - Member Name
     - Email Address
     - Phone Number
     - Maintenance Type (Monthly/Quarterly/Annual)
     - Default Maintenance Amount
   - Click "➕ Add Flat" to save

3. **View All Flats**
   - Click "📋 View All Flats" to see the list
   - See statistics:
     - Total Flats
     - Number of Societies
     - Total Monthly Maintenance

4. **Edit Flat Information**
   - Click "✏️ Edit" on any flat card
   - Update the information

5. **Delete Flat**

   - Confirm deletion

### For Users Making Payments:

1. **Auto-Fill Payment Form**

   - Select your flat number
   - All your information is automatically filled:
     - Member Name
     - Email
     - Phone
     - Default Maintenance Amount
     - Flat details (wing, floor)

2. **Manual Entry**
   - If your flat is not in the system, select "➕ Enter Manually"
   - Fill in all details manually as before

3. **Make Payment**
   - Verify the auto-filled information
   - Adjust the amount if needed (for special payments)
   - Click "Pay" to proceed
